# Changelog

## 1.0.1

* Fix for issue where content-disposition for file downloads uploaded with CLI contained single quotes that broke the filename that browsers used for file download

## 1.0.0

* Support for Preside 10.14 'file system' storage provider methods that allow operations just on local file paths, rather than binary objects loaded into memory.
* Support using the AWS CLI to perform GETs and PUTs of objects rather than the Java API - minimize java memory usage

## 0.9.11

* [#4](https://github.com/pixl8/preside-ext-s3-storage-provider/issues/4) ensure mimetype and content disposition is correctly set when moving an object

## 0.9.10

* Ensure the new Preside 10.12 "ScheduledExportStorageProvider" is automatically converted to S3


## 0.9.9

## 0.9.4

* Fix bad argument names that break with the admin GUI setup of asset manager storage providers

## 0.9.2

* Fix fieldnames for form validation
